Use case
-----
Excell sheets are useful to manage a own collection of crypto currencies. But sometimes you
will destroy you trading/invenstment history by updating the fiat-prices of your crypto currencies
like Bitoin, Ethereum or IOTA. Maybe you are using different exchanges, f.e. today (august 2017)
you cannot trade IOTA on Kraken or Bittrex. Typically you have Bitcoins stored on many different
exchanges, paper-wallets or hardware-wallets, but for you interest you only want to calculate with
a single value, the accumulation of all BTC-positions.

This project consist only of one single index.php and a subdirectory of your hard-asset investment.
It should be also useful to use this tool to manage the value of gold- and silver coins like KrÃ¼gerrand 
or silvr Maple-Leaf :blush:.
